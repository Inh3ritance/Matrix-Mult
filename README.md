# Matrix-Mult
<b>Technology: </b><i>C++,Visual Studio,Terminal</i>

Command Console Program made Multiplying N X M Matrices through diffrent techniques including Classical, Divide and Conquer, and Strassens Method. I really enjoyed this school project as it focused on the idea of runtime processes, and how to save both on memory allocation and reduce processesing count in C++. This also gave me the chance to document my code thouroughly and submit my analysis to where my Matrices could muliply up to N = 16,000 when given enough time.

This is a complete project that I built. To view older progress of this application:
